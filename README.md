# Navigating US Economic Cycles: A Tableau-Based Analysis of State-Level Unemployment Trends (1975–2030)

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Tableau-based analysis of US unemployment trends across all 50 states from 1975 to 2025, with predictive forecasting extending through 2030. The interactive dashboard and storyboard provide policy makers and economic analysts with actionable insights into regional economic disparities, historical patterns, and future labor market trajectories.

## Business Context: Why It Matters

Unemployment rates are critical economic indicators that fluctuate significantly over time. Understanding these trends is essential because:

- **Economic Policy Impact:** Unemployment levels directly influence the effectiveness of economic policies and external economic factors
- **Regional Disparities:** Identifying specific regions struggling with high unemployment helps address geographical economic inequalities
- **Historical Learning:** Analyzing past economic downturns (1980s recession, 2008 financial crisis) enables better preparation for future fluctuations
- **Proactive Planning:** Forecasting future trends allows for strategic resource allocation and intervention before crises develop

## Key Features

###  Interactive Visualizations
- **Geographic Heat Maps:** Color-coded state-level unemployment distribution (darker colors = higher unemployment)
- **Trend Line Analysis:** Historical unemployment patterns from 1975-2025
- **Scatter Plot Analysis:** Relationship between civilian labor force size and unemployment rates
- **Comparative Dashboards:** Side-by-side state comparisons (e.g., Texas vs. California)

###  Predictive Analytics
- **Unemployment Forecasting:** Machine learning-based predictions extending to 2030
- **Trend Extrapolation:** Identifies states at risk of rising unemployment
- **Strategic Planning Tools:** Enables proactive economic intervention

###  Analytical Capabilities
- **Outlier Detection:** Identifies states with consistently high or low unemployment
- **Factor Analysis:** Explores relationships between labor force size and unemployment
- **Regional Benchmarking:** Compares economic trajectories across different states
- **Interactive Filtering:** Drill-down capabilities by state, year, and metrics

## Tools & Technologies

- **Primary Platform:** Tableau Desktop/Tableau Public
- **Data Analysis:** Statistical forecasting and trend analysis
- **Visualization Techniques:**
  - Geographic mapping
  - Time-series analysis
  - Scatter plot correlation analysis
  - Predictive modeling

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Collected historical unemployment data (1975-2025) for all 50 US states
- Integrated civilian labor force statistics
- Cleaned and normalized data for consistent analysis

### 2. Visualization Design
- **Geographic Distribution Maps:** Immediate visual identification of regional unemployment patterns
- **Consistent Color Schemes:** Standardized color mapping for easy interpretation
- **Interactive Filters:** Year, state, and metric-based filtering for custom analysis
- **Clear Labeling:** All visualizations include comprehensive legends and annotations

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Applied time-series forecasting techniques to historical data
- Generated unemployment projections through 2030
- Validated models against historical recession/recovery patterns

### 4. Comparative Analysis
- Benchmarked high-performing vs. struggling states
- Identified correlation between labor force size and unemployment trends
- Analyzed impact of major economic events (recessions, recoveries)

---

## Key Insights & Outcomes

###  Identification of Economic Patterns
- Successfully mapped historical unemployment fluctuations across 50+ years
- Identified states consistently experiencing high unemployment requiring intervention
- Documented states with economic resilience and best practices

### Predictive Capabilities
- Developed forecasting models to anticipate unemployment trends through 2030
- Enabled proactive economic policy development
- Provided early-warning system for states at risk of rising unemployment

###  Actionable Intelligence
- Created comprehensive storyboard answering complex labor market questions
- Delivered holistic view of how regional factors impact national economy
- Provided benchmarking tools for state-to-state comparison

###  Strategic Decision Support
- Equipped policy makers with data-driven insights for resource allocation
- Identified outlier states for targeted economic intervention
- Revealed correlation patterns between civilian labor force and unemployment

## Project Analogy

**Think of this project as a GPS for the labor market:**
- **Rearview Mirror:** Shows historical terrain (past recessions and recoveries)
- **Current Location:** Displays present-day state unemployment rates
- **Route Guidance:** Provides forecasted trends to help avoid future "traffic jams" (rising unemployment)

Just as a GPS helps drivers navigate efficiently, this dashboard helps policy makers navigate economic cycles strategically.

## How to Use the Dashboard

### For Policy Makers
1. Use geographic heat maps to identify states requiring economic intervention
2. Compare your state's trajectory against national averages and peer states
3. Review forecasting data to plan proactive economic policies

### For Economic Analysts
1. Utilize scatter plots to understand labor force dynamics
2. Apply interactive filters to isolate specific time periods or regions
3. Export data visualizations for reports and presentations

### For Researchers
1. Explore historical recession/recovery patterns
2. Identify correlations between economic events and unemployment spikes
3. Use predictive models to test economic scenarios
